Astro-Menu is equipped with an advanced auto-translation feature, designed to bridge language gaps and enhance the dining experience for international customers. This feature allows restaurant managers to select target languages, with the number of available languages varying based on the subscription plan. The system then translates essential elements such as the restaurant name, description, menu sections, meal titles, and descriptions into the selected languages.

This ensures that customers can browse the menu in their preferred language, with translations appearing as if they were natively written.

## Elimination of Extension Bugs

Browser-based translation extensions often rely on third-party services and can be prone to bugs and compatibility issues. These extensions may not always function correctly, leading to incomplete or inaccurate translations. By offering a pre-translation solution, Astro-Menu ensures that all menu translations are completed and verified before they reach the customer's device. This eliminates the risk of translation errors caused by extension malfunctions, ensuring that customers always receive accurate and reliable information.

## Consistent User Experience

Pre-translation ensures that the menu looks professional and consistent across all devices and languages. Restaurant managers can review and edit translations to avoid errors, ensuring that the menu maintains its intended tone and style in every language. This consistency is crucial for maintaining the restaurant's brand image and providing a high-quality customer experience.
