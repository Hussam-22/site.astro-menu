## Reduced Workload for Staff:

With customers placing orders themselves, waitstaff can focus on delivering food and attending to other customer needs, rather than taking orders. This can lead to faster table turnover and more attentive service

## Error Reduction:

Direct input from customers reduces the risk of miscommunication and order errors. This ensures that orders are accurate and tailored to customer preferences, enhancing satisfaction.
