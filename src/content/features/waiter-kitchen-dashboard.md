Integrating Waiter(ess) and Kitchen Dashboards into a restaurant with Astro-Menu can transform the way the establishment operates. These dashboards streamline communication and coordination between front-of-house and back-of-house staff, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. When a customer places an order through the Self Order feature, the details are instantly relayed to both the waitstaff and the kitchen, reducing the chances of miscommunication and errors.

The real-time updates provided by the dashboards enable the waitstaff to manage customer expectations more effectively, as they can see the status of each order as it progresses. This transparency helps in delivering a better dining experience, as waitstaff can promptly address any issues or special requests.

Additionally, the system supports real-time updates, incorporating real-time inventory management into Astro-Menu’s Waiter(ess) and Kitchen Dashboards offers significant benefits for restaurant operations. When meals go out-of-stock, the system instantly updates the customer menus, preventing orders for unavailable items.

## Faster Order Processing

Orders are processed more quickly as they are sent directly to the kitchen without the need for a waiter to relay them manually. This speeds up the preparation and delivery of food.

## Customer Dissatisfaction

Prevent customer dissatisfaction and potential anger. By avoiding situations where customers order out-of-stock items, the restaurant reduces the likelihood of negative experiences and complaints. This proactive approach to inventory management ensures a smoother, more enjoyable dining experience for all patrons.

## Status Monitoring

The dashboard allows kitchen staff to update the status of each order, from preparation to completion, providing waitstaff with accurate information to relay to customers.
