The Social QR code is specifically designed for sharing on your social media accounts or displaying on your front window, allowing you to showcase your menu to a broader audience.

While it is technically possible to use the Social QR code at tables, doing so means missing out on many features that come integrated with the <FeatureLink link='/features/branches/tables-qr' text='Tables QR' />. These features are tailored to optimize and simplify ordering processes. Additionally, note that the Social QR code has a monthly scan limit of 3 million, ensuring compliance with our fair usage policy.
