The **Tables QR** code is specifically designed to be placed on tables, facilitating order-taking and streamlining the ordering process with a range of integrated features.

## Features

- #### Real-time Order Sync
  When a customer or waitstaff adds a meal to an order, the order cart is updated in real time for both parties.

- #### Real-time Meal Status Updates
  Waitstaff or kitchen staff can toggle meal availability from their PoS/dashboard, and these changes will be reflected instantly across all **Tables QR** codes. This helps reduce frustration and improve table turnover by only showing available meals.

- #### Individual Order Tracking
  Each table has a unique QR code, allowing you to track orders for each table separately.

- #### Call Waitstaff Bell
  Customers can request assistance from the menu, and the waitstaff will be notified on their PoS/dashboard with an alert sound.

- #### Order Summary Page
  Once an order is served, the menu automatically switches to an "Order Summary" page. Here, customers can view the total bill, call waitstaff, enter their email to receive an invoice of the paid bill, and leave a Google review by clicking the "Rate us on Google" button.

- #### Meal Filter
  The menu includes a "Filter" feature that helps customers quickly find specific meals or options that fit dietary preferences, such as gluten-free items.

- #### Change Menu Language
  To eliminate language barriers, Astro-Menu allows customers to change the menu language with the press of a button, ensuring they understand what they are ordering.
