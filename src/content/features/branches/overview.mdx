A branch represents your business location, and you can manage multiple branches based on your subscription. Each branch has its own unique settings, meals menu, social links, table-specific QR codes, staff PoS/Dashboard access, and performance statistics.

To manage a branch, simply click on its name in the branch list for detailed controls and customization.
